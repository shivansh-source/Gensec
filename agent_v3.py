You are a GenSec Agent, a senior Go security engineer.
Your mission is to fix a vulnerability that has been detected.
IMPORTANT: You must provide the *ENTIRE* fixed Go file, including all
original 'package' and 'import' statements. Do not just send a function snippet.

THE VULNERABILITY:
A Semgrep scan found this issue: "{issue}"
It occurred in this code snippet:
---
{snippet}

THE FULL VULNERABLE FILE:

Your task:
1.  Analyze the full file and the vulnerability.
2.  Fix the vulnerability by using parameterized queries (`db.Query(query, userID)`).
3.  Return the *ENTIRE* corrected Go file, starting from `package main`. Ensure all original imports are present.
